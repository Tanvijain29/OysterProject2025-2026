# Oyster Metapopulation Matrix Model

This repository contains code and data for a graduate thesis modeling the metapopulation dynamics of the eastern oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*) in two bays of Long Island Sound: Oyster Bay and Laurel Hollow.

The project uses a stage-structured matrix modeling framework incorporating fecundity, predation, and connectivity between subpopulations.

## Repository structure

- `data/raw/`  
  Empirical and literature-derived data used as inputs to the model (e.g., fecundity, predation rates). These files are not generated by code in this repository.

- `data/processed/`  
  Processed data and model input matrices (e.g., transition matrices, connectivity matrices) derived from raw data and assumptions described in the thesis.

- `scripts/`  
  R scripts used for data processing, spatial analysis, and model construction.

## Notes

This repository represents an active research project. Some files reflect intermediate stages of model development.
